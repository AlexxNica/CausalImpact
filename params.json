For example, how many additional daily clicks were generated by an advertising campaign? Answering a questions like this can be difficult when a randomized experiment is not available. The package overcomes this difficulty using a structural Bayesian time-series model to estimate how the response metric would have evolved after the intervention if the intervention had never occurred.
